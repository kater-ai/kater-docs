## What is Kater? 

Kater is a **data analysis workflow builder** and an **AI-powered report generator**.

Kater enables you to build decision trees of SQL, automate personalized reporting, and tell a story with your data.

It sits in the middle of your data stack, supplementing your BI tool to provide deeper and more flexible analytics.

Using a complex mesh of multi-modal agents, Generative AI and Retrieval AI, Kater allows you to rapidly build and iterate analytical flows using plain English. 

Build at the speed of thought, extract actionable insights, and turn your stakeholders into analytics leads.

## Quickstart
:::info[Get Set Up In 30 Minutes]
1. [Connect your data warehouse](./category/connect) (2 min)
2. [Set Up A Persona](./onboard-butler/query_bank) (2 min)
3. [Define Joins in Data Map](./data-map/data_map_intro) (5 min)
4. [Build a Playbook](./onboard-butler/concepts) (20 min)
:::


## How it works
### What is a Playbook?

#### Decision trees are the most natural way to brainstorm solutions to complex business problems. 

What if you could brainstorm a flow using plain English, rapidly transform it into SQL, and use the flow to generate reports dynamically?

:::note[The Problem with the Current Landscape]
Static dashboards don't provide the flexibility and interoperability to address the majority of stakeholder needs. Companies don't know what to focus on for the week and don't receive actionable insights.
:::

:::tip[The Solution]
**Decision trees** of questions that translates into SQL. Built by the data team, utilized and improved by business users. Also known as-- **Playbooks**! 
:::

* **For Data Teams:** You can build a `Playbook` which outlines a decision tree of questions/SQL/graphs for individual personas, used to automatically generate reports, insights, and stories.
* **For Business Users:** `Playbooks` act as guardrails for which questions to ask and hypotheses to verify based on your objectives. You can ask questions against the report generated by the `Playbook`.

### Knowledge sources
Kater connects to various sources to obtain the necessary context required to support Playbook building and SQL generation.

:::info
Currently, most of Kater's immediate info comes directly from your data warehouse's metadata upon connection. Kater infers your join keys and semantic relationships between your tables to generate a Data Map.

## Why Kater?
We're a team of former data engineers and analysts at Microsoft, Kaiser Permanente, Crexi, and Abbott, solving the problem of data accessibility and data literacy across organizations.

### The Business Intelligence Revolution
Prior to Generative AI, stakeholders accessed data through channels like Jira, Slack, and your Business Intelligence (BI) platform. 

The problems with this existing workflow are:

* Jira and Slack as "data service" options are inherently unscalable and time-consuming for both parties. 

* Business Intelligence (BI) platforms like Tableau provide a very narrow view into your database, limiting the scope of questions and answers someone can obtain.  

:::info 
Kater doesn't replace these options; rather, it functions as the glue in your data stack, serving as a stable, self-learning, and optimized data agent. 
:::

It integrates with your existing infrastructure, offering insights and support in areas where the data team may be constrained by time or resources.

### Look, a data team member! It's a unicorn!
Data has largely become a rare comodity due to the limited channels in which stakeholders can access the data team. 

While stakeholders can start retrieving answers to their questions faster, data teams are simultaneously relieved of pressure to respond to urgent adhoc requests.

We aim to make Kater a fun, interactive, curiosity-driven platform which encourages its users to utilize data on a daily basis, from open-ended discovery and exploration, to detailed white-paper analyses.

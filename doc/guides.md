# Get Started with Kater.ai

## What is Kater? 

Kater is a **data analysis workflow builder** and an **AI-powered report generator**.

Kater enables data experts to build decision trees of SQL, automate personalized reporting, and tell a story with their data.

It sits in the middle of a company's data stack, supplementing their BI tool to provide deeper and more flexible analytics.

</div>

Using a complex mesh of multi-modal agents, Generative AI and Retrieval AI, Kater allows data experts to rapidly build and iterate **analytical flows** using plain English. 

Business users can then utilize Butler, their AI agent, to ask questions about the **analytical flows**, and receive personalized answers to support their individual needs.

Build at the speed of thought, extract actionable insights, and turn your stakeholders into analytics leads.

## How it works
### Data Playbooks

**Decision trees are the most natural and effective way to brainstorm solutions to complex business problems.** 

What if you could brainstorm a flow using plain English, rapidly transform it into SQL, and use the flow to generate reports dynamically?

:::warning[The Problem with the Current Landscape]
Static dashboards don't provide the flexibility and interoperability to address the majority of stakeholder needs. Companies don't know what to focus on for the week and don't receive actionable insights.
:::

:::tip[The Solution]
**Decision trees** of questions that each represents a materialized view. Built by the data team, version controlled, utilized and improved by business users. Also known as-- **Playbooks**. 
:::

![sources](../static/img/Playbook.png)

In every analyst’s head, there’s a complex web of decision-tree structures that guide them to know 
1. what data exists,
2. which hypotheses to validate, 
3. how to write the SQL to obtain the data.

That's exactly what `Playbooks` are built to capture.

* **For Data Teams:** 
    * You can build a `Playbook` which outlines a decision tree of questions for individual personas, used to automatically generate reports, insights, and stories.
    * Each node represents one SQL query, which is stored as a `view` in your data warehouse. This is version controlled so you can manage changes over time and follow SWE best practices.
* **For Business Users:** 
    * `Playbooks` act as guardrails for which questions to ask and hypotheses to verify based on your objective. 
    * You can ask questions about the report generated by the `Playbook` just like how you'd ask a data team member. Butler will personalize answers for you.

### Knowledge sources
Kater connects to various sources to obtain the necessary context required to support Playbook building and SQL generation.

Kater currently connects with 
* most data warehouses ([Snowflake](./connect/Snowflake), [BigQuery](./connect/BigQuery), [Redshift](./connect/Redshift), [Databricks](./connect/Snowflake))
* [dbt Cloud](./connect/integrations/dbt)
* [Slack](./connect/integrations/slack)
* [GitHub](./connect/integrations/github)

:::info
Most of Kater's immediate info comes directly from your data warehouse's metadata upon connection. Kater infers your join keys and semantic relationships between your tables to generate a Data Map.

## Why Now?
We're a team of former data engineers and analysts at Microsoft, Kaiser Permanente, Crexi, and Abbott, who have committed our lives to solving the complex problem of data accessibility and data literacy across organizations.

:::tip[One Problem Is Clear]
Through hundreds of discovery interviews with seasoned data professionals and our personal experiences, one problem stood out the greatest:

**An astronomically wide knowledge gap exists between the data team and domain experts.**

### The Business Intelligence Revolution
Prior to Generative AI, stakeholders accessed data through channels like Jira, Slack, and your Business Intelligence (BI) platform. 

The problems with this existing workflow are:

* Jira and Slack as "data service" options are inherently unscalable and time-consuming for both parties. 

* Business Intelligence (BI) platforms like Tableau provide a very narrow view into your database, limiting the scope of questions and answers someone can obtain.  

:::info[It's time to bridge the gap] 
Kater doesn't replace these options; rather, it functions as the glue in your data stack, serving as a stable, self-learning, actions-oriented platform. Supplementing the gap that currently exists.
:::

It integrates with your existing infrastructure, offering insights and support in areas where the data team may be constrained by time or resources.

### Look, a data team member! It's a unicorn!
Data has largely become a rare comodity due to the limited channels in which stakeholders can access the data team. 

While stakeholders can start retrieving answers to their questions faster, data teams are simultaneously relieved of pressure to respond to urgent adhoc requests.

We aim to make Kater a fun, interactive, curiosity-driven platform which encourages its users to utilize data on a daily basis, from open-ended discovery and exploration, to detailed white-paper analyses.

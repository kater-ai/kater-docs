# Query Bank
:::info This serves as the foundation for Butler's memory. 

All previously asked questions + their SQL lives here.

This is the playbook of all questions asked to the data team. The more you use it, the better Butler will get.

## Adding to the Bank
:::info There are 2 ways to add to the Query Bank: 
1. Through the `Query Bank` tab
2. Through the <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up" /> / <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-thumbs-down" /> feedback loop in `Ask` tab
:::

### 1. Through the Query Bank tab (Technical Users)
Navigate to "Query Bank" in the sidebar, and you should be on the "Add to Bank" tab.

We recommend starting with adding 10-15 questions that answer your company's primary business objectives. 

:::tip
What are the most commonly asked questions to the data team? What are some questions that are currently being asked?
:::

#### Adding a Question
1. **Ask a question** and have Butler generate SQL for you.
2. **Edit** the SQL accordingly & review the output. 
3. Check the **data sources** to understand how Butler is getting to the answer. 
4. **Save the Question.** Now it will appear in the Query Bank and will inform Butler's future decisions.

    </video>
</div>

:::tip 
If you can't think of a question and you already have a SQL query, Butler can generate the question for you based on your SQL query using this button:
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", padding: "1rem 0 2rem 0" }}>
    <img src={require("../../static/img/GenerateQForMe.png").default} width="100%" />
</div>
:::

### 2. Through providing feedback in Ask tab (Non-Technical Users)
Users (non-admin) can add to the query bank when they add feedback about a question they've asked.

These show up in the Query Bank as `unverified`. 

:::warning
The questions will be stored in Butler's memory for future use **only after** an admin verifies the question.

## Why a Query Bank?
The reason is two-fold. It serves a business purpose as well as a technical purpose. 
### <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-business-time" /> Business Use Case 
One of the biggest challenges of any data team is **keeping track** of all asked questions, the **SQL queries** associated with those questions, and the **decisions made** after answering those questions.

Typically, data analysts receive the same question, try to find the query they wrote 3 months ago, then spend an additional 30 minutes re-familiarizing themselves with the query to tweak it enough to serve the stakeholder's needs.

:::tip
Now, every question a data analyst solves can be used to inform a future similar question. No more repeat queries!
:::

**Furthermore, every stakeholder asks a question because they're solving a business problem.** We want to help you keep track of those business problems, the questions associated with them, and the decision made.

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench" /> Technical Use Case
Our preliminary experiments show that storing questions and their associated SQL, indexing, and searching through them using RAG **improves generated SQL accuracy up to 88%.** 

Further, questions that utilize a previously verified question of up to 60% similarity have a **98% accuracy rate.**

:::tip
This means that by the time you have **50 saved questions** in the Query Bank, you'll have solved for **50*10 = 500 iterations** of different questions people can ask in the future.

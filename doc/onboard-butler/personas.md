# Personas
:::info
A `Persona` is a representation of a team member with a specific set of business questions, metrics, and data sources that they care about.

This helps Butler tailor his data sources and responses to the business requirements of the `Persona`.

## Onboarding a data analyst

Think about it like this: if you were to onboard a new data analyst today, what business vertical would you assign them to learn about and become the resident expert in? 

* Would you assign them to the **Sales team**, where they would learn about the sales process, the sales funnel, and the sales metrics? 

* Would you assign them to understand the **newest product feature** your company is launching, and the metrics that are important to track for that feature?

* Or would you assign them as part of your **Market Expansion Project** to understand the new markets you are entering, and the metrics that are important to track for that project?

## Personas can be specific or general

`Personas` can represent different projects, product verticals, business domains, or any combination of the above. 

It organizes the chaos of data into a structure that mirrors the priorities and requirements of your organization.

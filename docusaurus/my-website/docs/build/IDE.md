# Kater IDE

We provide two environments for developers to transform their data: the **Kater IDE** and **Kater's VS Code Extensions**. 

## VS Code Extensions
We are starting with VS Code Extensions<sup style={{color: "dodgerblue", fontSize: "0.8rem"}}>Beta</sup> to allow users to build in a familiar environment.

Still in development. Stay tuned! Sign up for [our waitlist](https://www.kater.ai/waitlist) to be first to hear when it releases.

## Kater-specific IDE 
Users can also use our browser-based IDE<sup style={{color: "dodgerblue", fontSize: "0.8rem"}}>Beta</sup> which is built specifically for Kater's functions. 

The goal is to create an IDE built specifically for data transformations and seemlessly integrates with all of Kater's platform features. 

Still in development. This will be released after the VS Code Extensions.
